# <span style='color:yellow'> The word <span style='color:red'>_ん_</span> in Japanese

- The "n" sound (<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>) at the end of different sounds creates an "n" sound, for example た<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span> => "tan". It's pronounced like the "n" sound in Vietnamese. However, if it appears before sounds in the "M", "B", or "P" series, it must be pronounced as "M" even though it's still written as "<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>". Examples:

  - 先輩（せ<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>ぱい） is pronounced as /sempai/ instead of /senpai/.
  - 全部（ぜ<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>ぶ）(everything) is pronounced as /zembu/ instead of /zenbu/.
  - え<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>ぴつ (pencil) is pronounced as /empitsu/ instead of /enpitsu/.

  It's usually pronounced as /ng/ when it appears before k, (g), y, w, or at the end of a word. Examples:

  - お<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>がく is pronounced as /onggaku/
  - かば<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span> (bag) is pronounced as /kabang/
  - ど<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span> (what) is pronounced as /dong/

- If the "<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>" sound stands alone and is pronounced as a single letter, it's pronounced as "un" or in Vietnamese as "ưn/ưng". Usually, singers will pronounce each letter clearly when singing, for example "た<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>" (tan) will be sung as "ta ưn". To type "<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>", you type "n" twice, meaning "n + n". Or you can type "n" and then the next consonant, and it will automatically become "<span style='color:red'>_ん_</span>".

# <span style='color:yellow'> Japanese "G" Sound Pronunciation Rules

In Japanese, the letter "G" **(the が、ぎ、ぐ、げ、ご sounds)** can be pronounced in two different ways:

1.  **Hard G**: Like the "g" in "go" or "get" in English
2.  **Nasal G**: A nasalized sound where air flows through the nose, similar to "ng" in English

Here are the rules governing when each pronunciation is used:

## 1\. Word-Initial Position: Always Hard G

When "G" appears at the beginning of a word, it's always pronounced as a hard G.

**Examples:**

- 学校 (gakkō) - school
- 元気 (genki) - energy/health
- 銀行 (ginkō) - bank
- 五 (go) - five

## 2\. Mid-Word Position: Nasal G

When "G" appears in the middle of a word, it's typically pronounced as a nasal G.

**Examples:**

- 日本語 (nihon**g**o) - Japanese language
- 天気 (ten**g**i) - weather
- 右側 (mi**g**i-gawa) - right side
- 挙げる (a**g**eru) - to raise up

## 3\. Particle が: Nasal G

The subject-marking particle が is typically pronounced with a nasal G.

**Examples:**

- 私**が**行きます (watashi **ga** ikimasu) - I will go
- 猫**が**好きです (neko **ga** suki desu) - I like cats
- この本**が**面白い (kono hon **ga** omoshiroi) - This book is interesting

## 4\. Number 5 (五): Always Hard G

The number 5 (五/ご) is always pronounced with a hard G, regardless of position.

**Examples:**

- 五人 (**go**\-nin) - five people
- 五月 (**go**\-gatsu) - May (fifth month)
- 第五章 (dai-**go**\-shō) - chapter five

## 5\. Onomatopoeia and Katakana Words: Always Hard G

Words that represent sounds (onomatopoeia) and foreign loanwords written in katakana always use the hard G pronunciation.

**Examples:**

- ギター (**gi**tā) - guitar
- ガラス (**ga**rasu) - glass
- ギリギリ (**gi**ri**gi**ri) - just barely
- ゴロゴロ (**go**ro**go**ro) - rumbling sound

# Japanese Sentence Stress

## Basic Concepts

In Japanese:

- Words typically don't receive strong stress like in English
- Pitch (high vs. low) is more important than loudness
- Each word has its own pitch pattern
- The rhythm tends to be more flat and syllable-timed

## Pitch Accent Patterns

Japanese words follow specific pitch patterns:

1.  **Flat**: All syllables have the same pitch
2.  **High-beginning**: First syllable high, then drops
3.  **Low-beginning**: First syllable low, then rises
4.  **Mid-peak**: Rises then falls

### Examples

Let's look at some common words:

- はし (hashi)
  - はし ↓ (low-high): bridge
  - ↓ はし (high-low): chopsticks
- あめ (ame)
  - あめ ↓ (low-high): rain
  - ↓ あめ (high-low): candy

The arrow (↓) shows where the pitch drops.

## Sentence Level Patterns

At the sentence level, Japanese has these key features:

1.  **Phrase-based units**: Japanese groups words into phrases called "bunsetsu"
2.  **Downstep**: Pitch gradually lowers throughout a sentence
3.  **Question intonation**: Questions often rise at the end

### Example Sentences

1.  **Statement**: 私は学生です。(Watashi wa gakusei desu.) - I am a student.
    - わ ↓ たし は がく ↓ せい です
    - Notice how "watashi" starts high then drops, and "gakusei" has its own drop
2.  **Question**: 彼は先生ですか？ (Kare wa sensei desu ka?) - Is he a teacher?
    - か ↓ れ は せん ↓ せい です か ↗
    - The final か (ka) rises slightly in pitch
3.  **Emphasis**: 明日行きます！ (Ashita ikimasu!) - I'll go tomorrow!
    - あ ↓ した いきます
    - When emphasizing "tomorrow," the pitch range on "ashita" might be slightly wider

# <span style='color:yellow'> Bunsetsu: Japanese Phrase-Based Units

A "bunsetsu" (文節) is a fundamental unit of Japanese grammar that functions as a building block for sentences. Let me explain this concept in simple terms:

## What is a Bunsetsu?

A bunsetsu is a basic phrase unit consisting of:

- One content word (like a noun, verb, adjective)
- Any associated particles or auxiliary words

You can think of bunsetsu as the smallest meaningful chunks in a Japanese sentence.

## Examples of Bunsetsu

Let's break down a simple sentence into bunsetsu:

**私は学校に行きます。**  
(Watashi wa gakkou ni ikimasu.)  
"I go to school."

This sentence has 4 bunsetsu:

1.  **私は** (watashi wa) = "I" + topic particle
2.  **学校に** (gakkou ni) = "school" + direction particle
3.  **行き** (iki) = "go" (verb stem)
4.  **ます** (masu) = polite ending

## How Bunsetsu Affects Pronunciation

Each bunsetsu often has its own pitch pattern. When speaking Japanese:

- The pitch usually rises or falls within each bunsetsu
- There's often a slight pause between bunsetsu
- The pitch patterns don't cross bunsetsu boundaries

For example, in 「私は」(watashi wa):

- わ ↓ たし は - The pitch rises on "ta" and then falls on "shi," and "wa" continues the low pitch
